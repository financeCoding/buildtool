buildtool
=========

buildtool is a simple build system for Dart that works well standalone or with
the Dart Editor. buildtool configurations are simple Dart scripts.

buildtool helps you keep your project clean and run common tasks like dart2js
and the web components compiler. buildtool is designed to be fast and 
unobtrusive so that you can always have a fast edit and refresh development
process.
