/**
 * buildtool is a simple build system for Dart that works well standalone or 
 * with the Dart Editor. buildtool configurations are simple Dart scripts.
 * 
 * ## Usage ##
 * 
 * Builds are configured by adding a set of tasks, and the files they should be
 * run against, in a closure provided to [configure].
 * 
 * To add a task, call [addTask] with a list of regexs for matching file names
 * and a task to run when files matching the regex change.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 *     main() {
 *       configure(() {
 *         addTask([".*\.html"], new WebComponentsTask());
 *       });
 *     }
 * 
 * For convenience, we recommend that developers providing tasks for their
 * tools to also provide a function that helps users register them, so for
 * example a user can simple install a task as follows:
 * 
 *     import 'package:buildtool/web_components.dart';
 *     
 *     main() {
 *       configure(() {
 *         webComponents(files: [".*\.html"]);
 *       });
 *     }
 * 
 * ## Client / Server Architecture ##
 * 
 * buildtool starts a seperate Dart process to run the build. This is done to
 * reduce startup times, allow the VM to warm up hot code in tasks, and to
 * preserve dependency information in memory.
 * 
 * The `server` flag controls whether buildtool is running as a server, or as a
 * client.
 * 
 * When executed as a client, without the `server` flag, the script looks for a
 * running buildtool server by reading the `.buildlock` file. If it can't find
 * running server, it starts one.
 * 
 * When running as a server, an HTTP server is started which listens for build
 * commands via a JSON-based protocol.
 * 
 * ## Warning ##
 * 
 * This library is extremely new and unfinished. It may change at any time.
